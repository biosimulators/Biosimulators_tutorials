# BioSimulators tutorials

This package provides several tutorials for BioSimulators Python APIs for simulation tools and BioSimulators-utils.

* Introspecting model/simulation files
    * [Extracting the possible inputs and outputs of simulations from model/simulation files](Introspecting models.ipynb)
    * [Extracting descriptions of simulations and plots from model/simulation files](Introspecting models.ipynb)
* Creating simulation projects
    * [Programatically creating SED-ML and COMBINE archives from model files](Programatically creating SED-ML and COMBINE archives from model files.ipynb)
* Identifying suitable simulation tools
    * [Programmatically getting information about the capabilities of simulation tools (supported model formats, modeling frameworks, simulation types, simulation algorithms) from BioSimulators](Programmatically getting information about simulation tools from BioSimulators.ipynb)
* Executing simulations
    * [Programatically executing individual simulations](Programmatically executing individual simulations.ipynb)
