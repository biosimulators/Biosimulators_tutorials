# BioSimulators tutorials

This package provides several tutorials for BioSimulators Python APIs for simulation tools and BioSimulators-utils.

* Introspecting model/simulation files
    * [Extracting the possible inputs and outputs of simulations from model/simulation files](Introspecting%20models.ipynb)
    * [Extracting descriptions of simulations and plots from model/simulation files](Introspecting%20models.ipynb)
* Creating simulation projects
    * [Programatically creating SED-ML and COMBINE archives from model files](Programatically%20creating%20SED-ML%20and%20COMBINE%20archives%20from%20model%20files.ipynb)
* Identifying suitable simulation tools
    * [Programmatically getting information about the capabilities of simulation tools (supported model formats, modeling frameworks, simulation types, simulation algorithms) from BioSimulators](Programmatically%20getting%20information%20about%20simulation%20tools%20from%20BioSimulators.ipynb)
* Executing simulations
    * [Programatically executing individual simulations](Programmatically%20executing%20individual%20simulations.ipynb)
    * [Programmatically executing entire simulation projects (COMBINE/OMEX archives that contain one or more models and one or more simulations in SED-ML format)](Programmatically%20executing%20simulation%20projects.ipynb)
