# BioSimulators tutorials

This package provides several tutorials for BioSimulators Python APIs for simulation tools and BioSimulators-utils.

1. Introspecting model/simulation files
    * [Extracting the possible inputs and outputs of simulations from model/simulation files](1.%20Introspecting%20models/Introspecting%20models.ipynb)
    * [Extracting descriptions of simulations and plots from model/simulation files](1.%20Introspecting%20models/Introspecting%20models.ipynb)
2. Creating simulation projects
    * [Programatically creating SED-ML and COMBINE archives from model files](2.%20Creating%20simulations/Programmatically%20creating%20SED-ML%20and%20COMBINE%20archives%20from%20model%20files.ipynb)
3. Validating models and simulations
    * ABC
4. Finding suitable simulation tools
    * [Programmatically getting information about the capabilities of simulation tools (supported model formats, modeling frameworks, simulation types, simulation algorithms) from BioSimulators](4.%20Finding%20simulation%20tools/Programmatically%20getting%20information%20about%20simulation%20tools%20from%20BioSimulators.ipynb)
5. Executing simulations
    * [Programatically executing individual simulations](5.%20Executing%20simulations/Programmatically%20executing%20individual%20simulations.ipynb)
    * [Programmatically executing entire simulation projects (COMBINE/OMEX archives that contain one or more models and one or more simulations in SED-ML format)](5.%20Executing%20simulations/Programmatically%20executing%20simulation%20projects.ipynb)
6. Combining multiple models and/or simulation tools into multi-algorithmic simulations
    * [Multi-algorithmic simulation of multiple models and simulation tools](6.%20Combining%20models%20and%20simulation%20tools%20into%20hybrid%20simulations/Multi-algorithmic%20simulation%20of%20multiple%20models%20and%20simulation%20tools.ipynb)
