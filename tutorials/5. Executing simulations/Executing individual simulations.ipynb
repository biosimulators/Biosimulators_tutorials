This flexibility functionality can be used for a variety of purposes such as for sampling ensembles of stochastic trajectories, scanning and estimating parameters, and co-simulating mutiple models.

    "BioSimulators uses SED-ML and KiSAO to provide investigators consistent APIs for executing simulations with multiple simulation tools. This simplicity has several advantages, including eliminating the need to learn distinct APIs for each tool, making it easy to run simulations with multiple tools such as to check reproducibility and validate simulation tools, and making it easier for investigators to co-simulate models that require distinct simulation methods and simulation tools. As a result, executing simulations through SED-ML and KiSAO requires simulation tools to map descriptions of models and simulations encoded in SED-ML and KiSAO into the simulation tool's internal representations.\n",
