    "To make it easy for investigators to work with a broad range of model formats, modeling frameworks, simulation types, simulation algorithms, and simulation tools, BioSimulators uses the [Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML)](http://sed-ml.org/) and [COMBINE/OMEX archive](https://combinearchive.org/) formats. \n",
    "\n",
    "BioSimulators uses SED-ML to describe simulation experiments. This includes:\n",
    "* Which models to simulate\n",
    "* How to modify models to simulate variants such as alternative initial conditions\n",
    "* What type of simulations to execute (e.g., steady-state, time course)\n",
    "* Which algorithms to use (e.g., CVODE, SSA)\n",
    "* Which observables to record\n",
    "* How to reduce the recorded values of the observables\n",

    "[runBioSimuations](https://run.biosimulations.org/create) provides a simple web form for building COMBINE/OMEX archives with SED-ML files from model files (e.g., CellML, SBML). In addition, [BioSimulators-utils](https://github.com/biosimulators/Biosimulators_utils) provides a command-line application building COMBINE/OMEX archives with SED-ML files from model files. Both tools support all of the modeling languages supported by BioSimulators. Instructions for using the command-line application are available at [https://docs.biosimulators.org](https://docs.biosimulators.org/Biosimulators_utils/).\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools are easy to use. However, they provide investigators little flexibility to customize the generation of COMBINE/OMEX archives and SED-ML files, such as to bundle simulations of multiple model files into a single COMBINE/OMEX archive. The BioSimulators-utils Python API provides additional flexibility to customize the creation of COMBINE/OMEX archives.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial illustrates how to use the BioSimulators-utils API to programmatically create COMBINE/OMEX archives from model files by illustrating the construction of a COMBINE/OMEX archive for a [flux balance model of the core metabolism of Escherichia coli](data/Escherichia-coli-core-metabolism.xml) encoded in SBML."
